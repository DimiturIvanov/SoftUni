/*
Every time Stamat tries to pay his bills he sees on the cash desk the sign: "I will be back in 30 minutes". One day
Stamat was sick of waiting and decided he needs a program, which prints the time after 30 minutes. That way he
wonâ€™t have to wait on the desk and come at the appropriate time. He gave the assignment to you, so you have to do
it.
Input - The input will be on two lines. On the first line, you will receive the hours and on the second you will receive the
minutes.
Output - Print on the console the time after 30 minutes. The result should be in format &quot;hh:mm&quot;. The hours have one or two
numbers and the minutes have always two numbers (with leading zero).
Constraints:
- The hours will be between 0 and 23.
- The minutes will be between 0 and 59.
